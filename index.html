                <h2>About Me:</h2>
                <p>Hi there! My name is Robert "Will" Lord and I am a passionate web developer excited to enter the
                    industry. I graduated from Southwestern University with a Bachelor's degree in Political Science
                    and have since gained a strong background in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, and Java, which
                    has enabled me to create dynamic and user-friendly websites that provide seamless experiences for
                    users.
                    I have worked on a variety of projects, from bootcamp portfolio projects to projects for small
                    busineess
                    in austin, and have always been dedicated to delivering high-quality work that exceeds expectations.
                    I
                    stay up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in web development and enjoy taking on new
                    and
                    exciting challenges in the
                    field.</p>

                        still ery much a work in progress. Prepare yourself</p>
